Speaking of mobile data, letâ€™s talk about the different types of cards available. If you prefer a physical SIM card, you can opt for a traditional mobile plan that works seamlessly across Panama. These plans often come with generous data allowances and flexible contract terms, making them ideal for travelers who need reliable connectivity. On the other hand, if youâ€™re into cutting-edge technology, an eSIM might be your best bet.
