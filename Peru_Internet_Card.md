No hidden fees, no surprisesâ€”just straightforward pricing that fits your budget.

But wait, thereâ€™s more! The **Peru Internet Card** also offers seamless roaming capabilities, so you donâ€™t have to worry about losing connection as soon as you cross borders. Plus, customer support is available 24/7 to assist with any queries or technical issues you might encounter. Speaking of technicalities, activating your eSIM is super simple. All you need is a compatible device (most modern smartphones support eSIM), and within minutes, youâ€™ll be set up and ready to go. 

For those who prefer physical SIM cards, fear not! The **Peru Internet Card** also offers traditional SIM card options for devices that do not support eSIM. These SIM cards come preloaded with data plans that can be easily topped up via their intuitive app or website.
