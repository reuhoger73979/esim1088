All you need is your passport (for international visitors) or ID document (for locals). Simply insert the card into your phone, follow the on-screen instructions to activate it, and voila! Youâ€™re online in minutes. No complicated setups or hidden feesâ€”just seamless access to the internet.

From bustling cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg to remote areas where Wi-Fi might be scarce, this card ensures youâ€™re always connected.

For those of you who are environmentally conscious, thereâ€™s another exciting option: eSIMs. An eSIM is essentially a digital SIM card that allows you to connect without physical cards.
